      After graduating with a National Diploma Certificate <br> in Mass Communication,
       I spent seven(7) month learning <br> web developing from a world class programmer.
        Over time, I became more fascinated <br> with programming than just knowing how to 
       use the computer and to return to the university <br> to earn an additional degree in Data Analytics.
